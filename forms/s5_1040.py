Fills in a Form 1040 Schedule 5.

The following values must be defined in data.json (in addition to any
requirements for the forms listed above):
    => name
    => ssn

Additionally, you can define 'estimated_fed' in data.json with details
about federal estimated tax payments.

Currently, it'll fill in the line for estimated federal tax payments.
