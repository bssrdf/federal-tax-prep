Fills in a Schedule C-EZ form.

The following keys must be defined in data.json:
    => name
    => ssn

    => address
    => address_city
    => address_state
    => address_zip

    => profession (principal business or profession, including product or service)
    => profession_code (from Schedule C tables)

    => business_exp (list of dictionaries containing 'description' and 'amount' keys, can be empty)
    => 1099_misc (list of dictionaries containing an 'other_income' key)
    
Additionally, the following keys are optional but supported:
    => meals (amount of deductible meals)
    => vehicle (dictionary containing 'dates', 'mileage' and 'mileage_rate' keys).
       [Assumes the vehicle was available for personal use, all miles driven were
        for business (and not commuting or other), the vehicle is the only vehicle,
        and that you have evidence to support the deduction but its not written.]

It makes the following assumptions:
    => Your business doesn't have a separate name or address.
    => You didn't make any payments that would require you to file a 1099.
